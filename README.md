# Module_11_Challenge

# Forecasting Net Prophet

I am a growth analyst at [MercadoLibre](http://investor.mercadolibre.com/investor-relations). With over 200 million users, MercadoLibre is the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. You've been tasked with analyzing the company's financial and user data in clever ways to make the company grow. So, I need to find out if the ability to predict search traffic can translate into the ability to successfully trade the stock.

Instructions

This section divides the instructions for this Challenge into four steps and an optional fifth step, as follows:

- Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic

- Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

- Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

- Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet

- Step 5 (optional): Forecast revenue by using time series models

## Technologies

I created it in Google Colab and also set it up to view it in Jupyter Lab. If you want to use it in Jupyter Lab then change the commented out sections in the forecasting_net_prophet file.
